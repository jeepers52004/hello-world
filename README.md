Learning Git
Me...let's see...I like programming even if I'm not good at it.  I've dabbled in
PHP and MySQL for a school project.  Now I'm trying to learn C along with some of the
ancillary tools that my employer uses in their software development team in an effort
to move into that group a little later down the road.
They use Jenkins instead of Git but the concepts will apply and Git will apply at other
employers.
